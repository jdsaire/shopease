# ShopEase

ShopEase is the e-commerce web application built for the Microsoft Frontend
Developer Specialization capstone project. It started with Activity 1
(business logic) and Activity 2 (Blazor components for product listings) of
the capstone's five activities, had a storefront-bridge pass that gave it a
real retail shell — expanded catalog, imagery, quantity controls, filtering,
a persistent cart summary — completed Activity 3: a full styling and
responsive-design pass with mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints and an
accessibility audit, completed Activity 4: input validation, simulated
authentication, a gated checkout screen, and a security test pass, closed out
three fixes found by using the deployed app afterward, and has now completed
Activity 5: cart persistence via local storage and a final cross-app
regression pass — the capstone's last graded activity. None of this changed
Activity 1 or 2's graded code.

## See It Live

**https://jdsaire.github.io/shopease/**

Click "Products" to browse the storefront: filter by category, sort by
price, reveal more with "Show more", and add items to your cart. Activity 1's original test page still
exists at `/cart-test` — it's just no longer linked in the sidebar, since
it was built for grading evidence rather than as something a shopper
browses into. See [`docs/how-to-run.md`](docs/how-to-run.md) for every way
to reach it.

for GitHub Codespaces and VS Code instructions.

## Tech Stack

- **Blazor WebAssembly** (.NET 10) — the entire app is C# compiled to
  WebAssembly and run client-side in the browser; there is no server-side
  project.
- **Bootstrap** — the CSS toolkit the scaffold ships with, used as-is.
- **GitHub Pages** — static hosting, deployed by
  [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
  on every push to `main`.

## What's Built So Far

- **Activity 1 — Business Logic**: a [`Product`](src/ShopEase/Models/Product.cs)
  class and a [`Cart`](src/ShopEase/Services/Cart.cs) class, backed by a
  simulated database (see below), proven out by a test page —
  [`CartTest.razor`](src/ShopEase/Pages/CartTest.razor) — that adds, removes,
  displays, and totals cart items.
- **Activity 2 — Components**: [`ProductCard.razor`](src/ShopEase/Pages/ProductCard.razor)
  (a reusable component with a `Product` parameter and an "Add to Cart" event)
  and [`Products.razor`](src/ShopEase/Pages/Products.razor) (a listing page
  rendering multiple cards, all wired to the same shared cart).
- **Storefront bridge** (between Activities 2 and 3): a twelve-product
  catalog with stock and placeholder imagery, a retail
  [`ProductCard`](src/ShopEase/Pages/ProductCard.razor) with a quantity
  stepper and remove control, category/price filtering on
  [`Products.razor`](src/ShopEase/Pages/Products.razor), a persistent
  [`CartSummary`](src/ShopEase/Layout/CartSummary.razor) in the header, and a
  real [`Home.razor`](src/ShopEase/Pages/Home.razor) landing page. Built as
  additions on top of Activity 1/2's classes and component parameters, not
  replacements for them — see [`docs/storefront-decisions.md`](docs/storefront-decisions.md)
  for the deferred and resolved design decisions behind it.
- **v2.2 — Last changes**: removed Home's sale-campaign preview section,
  fixed the header cart summary's alignment below desktop, and added
  progressive "Show more" paging to the storefront grid. See
  [`handoff/v2.2/`](handoff/v2.2/README.md).
- **Activity 3 — Responsive UI/UX**: a dedicated
  [`site.css`](src/ShopEase/wwwroot/css/site.css) holding this project's own
  styling, a strengthened visual hierarchy on
  [`ProductCard`](src/ShopEase/Pages/ProductCard.razor) and the storefront
  grid, mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints, and an accessibility pass (WCAG
  AA contrast, keyboard operability, visible focus indicators). See
  [`docs/activity-3-decisions.md`](docs/activity-3-decisions.md) and
  [`handoff/v3/`](handoff/v3/README.md).
- **Activity 4 — Secure Coding Practices**: an
  [`InputValidationService`](src/ShopEase/Services/InputValidationService.cs)
  applied to a new validated product search and a
  [login form](src/ShopEase/Pages/Login.razor); simulated authentication
  built on Blazor's real `AuthenticationStateProvider`/`AuthorizeView`
  abstraction, gating cart mutation and a new
  [checkout screen](src/ShopEase/Pages/Checkout.razor) on sign-in; and a
  [`/security-test`](src/ShopEase/Pages/SecurityTest.razor) evidence page.
  Every simulated element says so at its definition, and no file claims the
  app is secure against, prevents, or protects against any attack class —
  see [`docs/security-decisions.md`](docs/security-decisions.md),
  [`docs/security-testing.md`](docs/security-testing.md), and
  [`handoff/v4/`](handoff/v4/README.md).
- **v4.1 — Post-Activity-4 fixes**: restored working sign-in/checkout
  navigation on the live deploy (a base-relative-href regression the
  Activity 4 pass introduced), rebuilt the product search as a full ARIA
  combobox with a clear control and catalog-derived autocomplete, and
  separated the header's sign-in status from the cart summary. See
  [`handoff/v4.1/`](handoff/v4.1/README.md).
- **Activity 5 — State Management**: the shopping cart now persists to the
  browser's `localStorage`, surviving both a page refresh and closing the
  tab, via a new [`CartStorageService`](src/ShopEase/Services/CartStorageService.cs)
  and [`wwwroot/js/cartStorage.js`](src/ShopEase/wwwroot/js/cartStorage.js)
  JS interop wrapper, orchestrated entirely from
  [`MainLayout.razor`](src/ShopEase/Layout/MainLayout.razor) — `Cart.cs`
  needed zero changes. A final cross-app regression pass confirmed products
  still display correctly, the cart still updates, and Activity 4's
  authentication is unchanged. See
  [`docs/state-management-decisions.md`](docs/state-management-decisions.md)
  and [`handoff/v5/`](handoff/v5/README.md).

## Documentation

- [`docs/`](docs/README.md) — how to run this project, setup notes, and the
  capstone's grading criteria (kept for reference, not answered here).
- [`learning-mode/`](learning-mode/README.md) — a plain-language walkthrough of
  how this app was built and why, plus a glossary.
- [`handoff/`](handoff/README.md) — the plan each run was built from and its
  completion report, one subfolder per run.

Every folder under `src/ShopEase/` also has its own README explaining what
lives there.

## About the Simulated Database

Activity 1's brief asks for a local MySQL database. This app is a Blazor
WebAssembly client on static GitHub Pages hosting — there is no server process
here, so it cannot open a real MySQL connection or run any server-side
authentication. [`ShopDatabase.cs`](src/ShopEase/Services/ShopDatabase.cs) is a
clearly-labeled in-memory stand-in that mirrors the shape of that requirement
instead. No file in this repository claims a real database connection, real
authentication, or any server-side component exists.

## Out of Scope

All five graded activities are complete — there is no Activity 6. One item
remains deliberately deferred, recorded in
[`docs/storefront-decisions.md`](docs/storefront-decisions.md): out-of-stock
and insufficient-stock enforcement. `Stock` is displayed on every card but not
yet checked against cart quantity.
